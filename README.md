# openapi-employment-identifier

This repository contains OpenAPI data types related to employer identifiers.

This repository contains identifiers related to the employment domain, in Belgium typically registered at NSSO (RSZ/ONSS).
Not all organizations (with a CBE number) are employers. If you're looking for CBE-related types, please check the [organization identifier repository](https://github.com/belgif/openapi-organization-identifier/).

Within a major version, types remain backwards compatible once they are released.
Types in a beta version are not included in releases and may change in a backwards incompatible way.
